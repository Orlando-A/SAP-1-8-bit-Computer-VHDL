# SAP-1-8-Bit-Computer-VHDL
This project was inspired by Ben Eater's 8-bit computer YouTube series. The Simple as Possible computer as seen in Digital Computer Electronics by Albert Paul Malvino, Ph.D. Jerald A. Brown is a primitive computer with a bus, program counter, MAR, RAM, adder/subtractor, memory registers, output register, and a controller/sequencer. With these components, we can write simple programs to run on this computer. In this project, I modeled the SAP-1 computer using VHDL in Vivado. I also used a Basys 3 board to test and see if it worked. I am happy with how this project turned out since this was my first project ever after taking a Udemy course on VHDL fundamentals. This taught me a lot about VHDL and different modeling forms such as sequential and combinational logic. I am sure there is more to improve upon in my hardware description skills, and I will continue to learn more.
