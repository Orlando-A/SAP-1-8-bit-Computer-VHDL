# SAP-1-8-Bit-Computer-VHDL
This project was inspired by Ben Eater's 8-bit computer YouTube series. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU The Simple as Possible computer as seen in Digital Computer Electronics by Albert Paul Malvino, Ph.D. Jerald A. Brown is a primitive computer with a bus, program counter, MAR, RAM, adder/subtractor, memory registers, output register, and a controller/sequencer. With these components, we can write simple programs to run on this computer. In this project, I modeled the SAP-1 computer using VHDL in Vivado. I've attached the simulations results, along with anything else you would need to compile the project and upload on an FPGA board. I personally used a BASYS 3 board and it functioned properly.
